	* config.h: Updated license exception for OpenSSL, per the SFLC.

2007-10-15  Gisle Vanem  <gvanem@broadpark.no>

	* config.h: Added some HAVE_* for djgpp 2.04 and Watcom 1.7+.

	* Makefile.DJ: rewritten for including some files from ../lib.

	* Makefile.WC: Ditto. Handling source-files out-of current
	directory makes compliation a bit more painfull. AFAICS, one
	must use explicit rules.

2007-10-02  Gisle Vanem  <gvanem@broadpark.no>

	* config.h: Removed unused defines, added needed 'HAVE_*' defines.

	* Makefile.DJ: rewritten to be used from './src' directory.
	Added '-DOPENSSL_NO_KRB5' for OpenSSL build. Target is
	now wget.exe.

	* Makefile.WC: Added for building with OpenWatcom targeting
	32-bit DOS (DOS32A extender). 

2007-09-24  Gisle Vanem  <giva@bgnett.no>

	* Makefile.DJ, config.h: Added to support building on MS-DOS via
	DJGPP.
