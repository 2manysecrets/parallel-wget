                                 Hey Emacs, this is -*- outline -*- mode

This is the to-do list for Wget.  There is no timetable of when we plan to
implement these features -- this is just a list of things it'd be nice to see in
Wget.  Patches to implement any of these items would be gladly accepted.  The
items are not listed in any particular order.  Not all of them represent
user-visible changes.

* --retr-symlinks should cause wget to traverse links to directories too.

* Lots of noncompliant webservers issue HTTP redirects to relative URLs, and
  browsers follow them, so wget should too.

* Make wget return non-zero status in more situations, like incorrect HTTP auth.

* Timestamps are sometimes not copied over on files retrieved by FTP.

* Wget does not currently handle "fragment identifiers" (the part of a URL 
  starting with the '#' character) properly.

* Make -K compare X.orig to X and move the former on top of the latter if 
  they're the same, rather than leaving identical .orig files laying around.

* Add an option to save all text/html files with a .html extension so that when
  grabbing the output of a dynamically-generated remote page, you'll end up with
  a filename that will cause _your_ webserver to realize the saved static HTML
  file isn't text/plain (or an illegal CGI script in the case of *.cgi).

* Allow mirroring of FTP URLs where logging in puts you somewhere else besides 
  '/'. 

* Make `-k' convert <base href=...> too.

* Make `-k' check for files that were downloaded in the past and convert links 
  to them in newly-downloaded documents.

* -k should convert convert relative references to absolute if not downloaded.

* -k should convert "hostless absolute" URLs, like <A HREF="/index.html">.
  However, Brian McMahon <bm@iucr.org> wants the old incorrect behavior to still
  be available as an option, as he depends on it to allow mirrors of his site to
  send CGI queries to his original site, but still get graphics off of the
  mirror site.  Perhaps this would be better dealt with by adding an option to
  tell -k not to convert certain URL patterns?

* Add option to clobber existing file names (no `.N' suffixes).

* Introduce a concept of "boolean" options.  For instance, every
  boolean option `--foo' would have a `--no-foo' equivalent for
  turning it off.  Get rid of `--foo=no' stuff.  Short options would
  be handled as `-x' vs. `-nx'.

* Implement "thermometer" display (not all that hard; use an
  alternative show_progress() if the output goes to a terminal.)

* Add option to only list wildcard matches without doing the download.

* Add case-insensitivity as an option.

* Handle MIME types correctly.  There should be an option to (not)
  retrieve files based on MIME types, e.g. `--accept-types=image/*'.

* Implement "persistent" retrieving.  In "persistent" mode Wget should
  treat most of the errors as transient.

* Allow time-stamping by arbitrary date.

* Fix Unix directory parser to allow for spaces in file names.

* Allow size limit to files.

* Recognize HTML comments correctly.  Add more options for handling
  bogus HTML found all over the 'net.

* Implement breadth-first retrieval.

* Download to .in* when mirroring.

* Add an option to delete or move no-longer-existent files when
  mirroring.

* Implement a switch to avoid downloading multiple files (e.g. x and
  x.gz).

* Implement uploading (--upload URL?) in FTP and HTTP.

* Rewrite FTP code to allow for easy addition of new commands.  It
  should probably be coded as a simple DFA engine.

* Recognize more FTP servers (VMS).

* Make HTTP timestamping use If-Modified-Since facility.

* Implement better spider options.

* Add more protocols (e.g. gopher and news), implementing them in a
  modular fashion.

* Implement a concept of "packages" a la mirror.

* Implement correct RFC1808 URL parsing.

* Implement HTTP cookies.

* Implement more HTTP/1.1 bells and whistles (ETag, Content-MD5 etc.)

* Support SSL encryption through SSLeay or OpenSSL.
