# This script creates a Wget distribution (wget-VERSION.tar.gz).
# It uses `make dist' to do most of the work, but corrects some
# things that `make dist' doesn't and can't do.  Specifically:
#
# * Checks out the clean source from the Subversion repository to a
#   temporary directory.
# * Runs autoconf, configure and `make' in the doc and po subdirs to
#   make sure that all the generated files, such as `configure',
#   `wget.info', and translated PO files, end up in the distribution.
# * Optionally changes src/version.c and doc/version.texi to the
#   version forced by `--force-version'.
# * Runs `make dist' to produce the archive.
# * Removes the checkout.
#
# For example, to produce a Wget beta based on the latest sources on
# the trunk, with version changed to "1.23-beta10", run `dist-wget
# --force-version 1.23-beta10'.  You can choose which sources will be
# used by specifying `-b PATH' ("trunk" by default) in combination
# with one of `-D DATE' or `-r REVISION' (the latest revision by
# default).
#
# Use the MAKE environment variable to specify a different version of
# make, for example MAKE=gmake dist-wget ...
