Mailing List
============

The primary mailinglist for discussion, bug-reports, or questions about
GNU Wget is at <bug-wget@gnu.org>. To subscribe, send an email to
<bug-wget-join@gnu.org>, or visit
`http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-wget'. You do not need to
subscribe to send a message to the list; however, please note that
unsubscribed messages are moderated, and may take a while before they
hit the list--*usually around a day*.  If you want your message to show
up immediately, please subscribe to the list before posting.

   Archives for this list may be found at
`http://lists.gnu.org/pipermail/bug-wget/'.

   Additionally, there is the <wget-notify@addictivecode.org> mailing
list. This is a non-discussion list that receives bug report
notifications from the bug-tracker. To subscribe to this list, send an
email to <wget-notify-join@addictivecode.org>, or visit
`http://addictivecode.org/mailman/listinfo/wget-notify'.

   Previously, the mailing list <wget@sunsite.dk> was used as the main
discussion list, and another list, <wget-patches@sunsite.dk> was used
for submitting and discussing patches to GNU Wget.

   Messages from <wget@sunsite.dk> are archived at
     `http://www.mail-archive.com/wget%40sunsite.dk/' and at

     `http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.wget.general'.
